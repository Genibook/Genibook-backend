    Genibook will be offline for a while.

    Hey guys ðŸ‘‹, its the developer here!
    <br><br>
    Over the past four years I (yes, this project is made by one person ðŸ¤µ) have developed the code here from a simple
    script,
    to a discord bot, to a website, then finally to a functioning app (well, sort of functioning for now... ðŸ˜”). It has
    been my pleasure seeing users come, see their grades,
    and use the app. Even a download, just a teeny download, really made my heart happy inside ðŸ˜Š.

    <br><br>
    My goal for this app was to create a fast, efficent, <b> free</b>, and <b> private </b>, AND <b> opensource </b>
    gradebook
    viewer for students in montgomery - and I sort of did it.
    <br><br>

    I'm extremely sad to inform to you all that due to rising costs to host the code that brings everything together -
    from
    gpa calculation to assignment gathering
    - and multiple unresolvable technical difficuluties, genibook will be offline for at least <b> 3 months</b> ðŸ˜¢

    <br><br>
    As you might have noticed now, the app is half working, and it will remain this way until Genibook is back online.
    <br><br>

    HOWEVER, being offline does not mean that EVERYTHING is lost ðŸ¤©!! If you use the <b> continue as guest </b> feature,
    and manually input your course percents and more,
    you can calculate your gpa based on Montgomery High School's gpa calculation formula!

</p>
<h2> I truely thank you, <b> the user, the one who downloaded, tried, and maybe hated, maybed loved, this app</b></h2>
